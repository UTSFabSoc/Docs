### Which printer should I use?
Each machine has its own upsides and downsides, the best one to use depends on the needs of your project:
- If you only need to print in one colour - Use **[[Piper]]** of **[[Leaky]]** since they are the most reliable
- If you need to print in up to 4 distinct colours - Use **[[Basil]]**, however the AMS can be unreliable and difficult to use
- If you want to print in up to 2 colours and have a gradient between them - Use **[[Endermixer]]** as it is its speciality
- If you want to print something really long, or many small prints - Use the **[[Enderloop]]** as one of it print bed dimensions is effectively infinite.

### How can I make 3D models?

## Filament Library
### Difference between material types
- PLA: Most basic and general purpose material for 3D printing, easiest to print and work with, however, not particularity strong or heat/sun resistant
- PETG: More difficult to work with but creates stronger parts 
- TPU/TPE: These materials are both flexible rubber materials. TPE is slightly more flexible than TPU

### Restricted Materials
- ABS: At printing temperatures ABS plastic releases fumes, to make it safe it is recommended to use an enclosure for the printer and have good airflow or extraction which is impossible from the Harry Heath room
- Carbon Fibre: Carbon Fibre PLA releases splinters that lodge into skin when handled, both on the spool and in printed parts
