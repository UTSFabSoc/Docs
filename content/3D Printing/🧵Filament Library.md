### Difference between material types
- PLA: Most basic and general purpose material for 3D printing, easiest to print and work with, however, not particularity strong or heat/sun resistant
- PETG: More difficult to work with but creates stronger parts 
- TPU/TPE: These materials are both flexible rubber materials. TPE is slightly more flexible than TPU

### Restricted Materials
- ABS: At printing temperatures ABS plastic releases fumes, to make it safe it is recommended to use an enclosure for the printer and have good airflow or extraction which is impossible from the Harry Heath room
- Carbon Fibre: Carbon Fibre PLA releases splinters that lodge into skin when handled, both on the spool and in printed parts
