Basil is a Bambu Labs A1 connected to an AMS unit (Automatic Material System) allowing to switch between up to 4 different filaments automatically during a print.

While useful, the AMS can be unreliable and get stuck requiring help and/or maintenance from a human from time to time.

## How to change Filament
1. Just like with Leaky, use the the touchscreen to navigate to the `Filament` screen
2. Unlike Leaky, the filament screen will have two tabs at the top, one for managing the standard `External Spool` and another for managing the `AMS`
3. Select which source and/or the AMS slot you want to modify and select `Load` or `Unload`
4. The display should then guide you through the steps
