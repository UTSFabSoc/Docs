Welcome to the FabSoc Docs! Whether you're here for 3D printing or other kinds of fabrication, this is the key place for all the information you'll need!

## [[🖨️ 3D Printing]] 
The main activity of the club, 3D Printing! Fabsoc currently has 5 printers available for members to submit prints to which will be completed by a technician. Follow this link to view information about our printers, filament and more advanced tutorials for preparing models for printing.
## [[🔥Heat Press]]
Recently Fabsoc acquired a set of heat presses which can be used for a number of applications such as applying designs to objects like shirts and mugs as well as more unusual usages like reforming waste plastic from printing.
## [[🛠️ Other Tools]]
We also have a range of other tools to help you with your projects!
## [[🐈 Technician Zone]]
This section will primarily have information which is only useful to the FabSoc exec team - like information on how tools and systems (eg this wiki) are setup. Also worth noting, Links with the cat emoji (😺) can only be accessed if you are a Technician
