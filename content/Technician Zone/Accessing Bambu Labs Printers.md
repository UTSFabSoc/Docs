Due to their proprietary nature, the Bambu Labs printers ([[Piper]], [[Leaky]] and [[Basil]]) can only be accessed through Bambu Labs software or its derivatives. The two main options are:
1. [Orca Slicer](https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer): open source fork of Bambu Studio which also has some more features. Just be careful you download from a reputable source (such as following the link here) since many of the google results are fake/malware versions
2. [Bambu Studio](https://bambulab.com/en-au/download/studio): original software that Orca Slicer is based off, proprietary
Both applications essentially look and work the same so the rest of this guide works for both
