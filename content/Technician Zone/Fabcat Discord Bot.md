## Contributing to fabcat

> [!Warning] Work in progress

fabcat is made in Godot v4.5 with the discord.gd plugin. To edit the project follow these steps:
1. Download Godot v4.5
2. Clone the fabcat repo to your computer 
3. Add the `.env` file with the discord bot key
4. Open the project folder with Godot

### Project Structure
- `main.gd` - main script which manages everything at the top level, you shouldn't need to touch this
- `Tools.gd` - global script that contains helper functions usable from anywhere, currently just has a function to check if the user has the right permissions 
- `AutocompleteTools.gd` - global script that contains helper functions for command autocomplete
- `library.gd` - global script that manages the printer and spool library
- `datatypes`
	- `librarySave` - class used by `library.gd` to save data to storage
	- `printer` - class used to represent a printer
	- `spool` - class used to represent a spool
- `application_cmds` - folder that holds all the commands for Fabcat, do not rename or place commands elsewhere as they will not be picked up
### Application Command Structure
Each application command file is made up of up to 5 key parts, only `execute()` and `data` are required for a minimal command:
- `on_ready()` - this function runs once when the bot starts up, useful for connecting signals
- `on_autocomplete()` - this function is run every time the bot receives a new partially typed argument and can return a list of entries for the user to pick from
- `execute()` - function that is run when the user runs the command
- `on_interaction_create()` - gets run whenever the user interacts with components in a message such as buttons or a dropdown, requires a signal connection to be made in `ready()`
- `data` - defines the structure and arguments of the application command

### Running an instance of fabcat
1. In Godot, select `Project -> Export...` and export the Linux build
2. This should create a few files which you should move to your server, make sure to move the `.env` file here too
3. You may need to give the `.x86_64` executable permissions 
4. run the executable with the `--headless` argument
The bot should then be running! You may want to consider creating some sort of startup task so the bot can continue if something happens to the server
