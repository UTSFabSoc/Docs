The FabSoc Technician Google Account, more commonly referred to as just the *Technician Account* is the account that is used for accessing a number of FabSoc resources that require a google account login including but not limited to:
- Technician Emails
- Bambu Lab Account Login
- Tailscale Network

This is a publicly accessible page so no specific passwords will be listed here but I can supply links to where they are detailed in the FabSoc exec channels - You'll only be able to access these if you are a technician or higher in the fabrication society discord!

> [!DANGER] Warning
> Do not login to the technician account from any google app on your phone. Doing so will enable google prompt which means that whenever someone else tries to sign into the account, you will receive a prompt on your phone to allow or deny their login attempt. Not only would this be annoying for you but it also means that other technicians cannot access the account without you allowing them
> > [!Failure]- What do I do if I enabled google prompt
> > To disable google prompt you will need to remove all mobile phones attached to the google account to disable it, there are two main methods:
> > 1. From the phone that is logged in, go to google account settings and remove the technician account
> > 2. From the google account admin (any device), go to devices and force sign out all mobile devices - however this method will most likely trigger a google prompt challenge (It is possible to avoid challenges if you are at UTS since the system will be less suspicious of your login attempt)
