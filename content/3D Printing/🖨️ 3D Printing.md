### Which printer should I use?
Each machine has its own upsides and downsides, the best one to use depends on the needs of your project:
- If you only need to print in one colour - Use **[[Piper]]** of **[[Leaky]]** since they are the most reliable
- If you need to print in up to 4 distinct colours - Use **[[Basil]]**, however the AMS can be unreliable and difficult to use
- If you want to print in up to 2 colours and have a gradient between them - Use **[[Endermixer]]** as it is its speciality
- If you want to print something really long, or many small prints - Use the **[[Enderloop]]** as one of it print bed dimensions is effectively infinite.

### How can I make 3D models?
Check out our [[3D Modelling]] guide!

### What filament can I print with?
We have a list of FabSoc filaments in our [[ðŸ§µFilament Library]], If you want to print with your own spool or something special, please chat with us!
