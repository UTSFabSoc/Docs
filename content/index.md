Welcome to the FabSoc Docs! Whether you're here for 3D printing or other kinds of fabrication, this is the key place for all the information you'll need!

## [[üñ®Ô∏è 3D Printing]] 
The main activity of the club, 3D Printing! Fabsoc currently has 5 printers available for members to submit prints to which will be completed by a technician. Follow this link to view information about our printers, filament and more advanced tutorials for preparing models for printing.
## [[üî•Heat Press]]
Recently Fabsoc acquired a set of heat presses which can be used for a number of applications such as applying designs to objects like shirts and mugs as well as more unusual usages like reforming waste plastic from printing.
