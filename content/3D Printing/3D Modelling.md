- For technical/functional parts: [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal)
	- Proprietary and expensive software, but free for Students and Personal use
- For high detail models such as figurines: [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
	- Free and Open Source, but has a steep learning curve
- For simpler, low poly decoration modelling: [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/)
	- Free and Open Source. Much simpler to use than Blender but has less tools functionality too
